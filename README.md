# Welcome to Juicebox

We're thrilled your telling stories with Juicebox apps. This is a high level overview of what you can do with Juicebox.

\*\*\*\*[**Juicebox 3**](https://app.gitbook.com/@juicebox/s/juicebox-3/) is our "original recipe" data stories. These combine yaml with Python. In Juicebox 3 each story contains a similar structure that defines its own templates, css customization. In Juicebox 3, every story is self-sufficient and can be copied from one app to another.

\*\*\*\*[**Juicebox 4**](https://app.gitbook.com/@juicebox/s/juicebox-4/) ****represents what we learned from telling stories with Juicebox 3. CSS customization and html templates are re-usable across stories and even applications. Juicebox 4 checks every component of a story to make sure it is valid before attempting to load the story. Simpler Python data services are built on reworked, open-source SQL foundations.

\*\*\*\*[**Juicebox Open**](https://app.gitbook.com/@juicebox/s/juicebox-open/) is an easy-to-use storytelling framework built on top of the Juicebox 4 story structure. A Juicebox Open app can be extended with the full Juicebox 4 platform.

To get started with developing Juicebox apps, install [Devlandia](https://juicebox.gitbook.io/devlandia/).

## Building Data Services

Data services connect Juicebox to analytical data and allow Juicebox apps to perform custom logic and apply data permissions to users.

#### Juicebox 3

Juicebox 3 apps can use [Juicebox 3 Data Services](https://juicebox.gitbook.io/juicebox-3-data-services/) or [Juicebox 4 Data Services](https://juicebox.gitbook.io/juicebox-4-data-services/)

#### Juicebox 4

Juicebox 4 apps can use [Juicebox 3 Data Services](https://juicebox.gitbook.io/juicebox-3-data-services/), [Juicebox 4 Data Services](https://juicebox.gitbook.io/juicebox-4-data-services/), or [YAML Data Services](https://juicebox.gitbook.io/yaml-data-services/)

#### Juicebox Open

Juicebox Open data services are not currently configurable. Internally they use [YAML Data Services](https://juicebox.gitbook.io/yaml-data-services/).
